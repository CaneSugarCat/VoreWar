<b><u><i>Note from Flame</b></u></i> 
I know I'm missing a bunch of stuff
as this game is over six years old now and I can
only recall so much information on my own.
I'm especially unclear on who wrote what log messages
Or who wrote the events for that matter.
If you see anything missing that you would
like added, please don't hesitate to contact
me and let me know!
