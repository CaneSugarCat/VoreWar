RGB Values for demidragonskin pallette: 255, 240, 225, 210, 200, 190, 180, 165, 150, 135, 120, 105, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 25, 0

Pallettes/Colors:

DemidragonSkin (new palette):
- outer skin color
- inner skin color
- claw/horns color
- internals/bits color
- pattern color

EyeColors = ColorPaletteMap.GetPaletteCount(ColorPaletteMap.SwapType.RaijuSkin); (for antrhos only)
HairColors = ColorPaletteMap.GetPaletteCount(ColorPaletteMap.SwapType.UniversalHair);
!!! Skin color for demis is the skin color humans use !!!

!!!
IMPORTANT: you need throw lines into random unit code that forces initial generation of all the colors
to be the same, so if you for example assign outer skin color to unit.SkinColor and inner skin color to unit.AccessoryColor
then:

    internal override void RandomCustom(Unit unit)
    {
        base.RandomCustom(unit);

        unit.AccessoryColor = unit.SkinColor;
	(...)
	
plus the same for every assigned color for claw/horns, internals/bits and pattern
!!!
plus also add basically the same stuff that was added to Lupines reagrding rags/leader outfits and such

LAYERS:
dicks, balls, bellies and breasts behave the same as with my other races (look up deers for code) (tits the same layer as brests)
as for other stuff, layer numbers should be:

27 - upper horns (for demis)	
26 - hair
25 - upper horns (for anthros)
24 - ears outer, ears inner
23 - lower horns
22 - head pattern
21 - outer head, inner head, teeth/nose, mouth, eyes, SecondaryEyes, weapons (attack position)
6 - weapons (default positions)
5 - body pattern, limbs (for demis, might maybe use outer body on different layer for this), claws
4 - inner body, outer body, vagina
3 - back hair
2 - outer wings, inner wings, claw wings,
1 - outer tail, inner tail

Customisation count:
Wings - 10 (consisting of 3 sprites each: inner wings, outer wings, claw wings)
Tails - 10 (8 first consist of inner tail and outer tail, last two just outer tail)
Hairstyles (for anthros) - 32+1 (1 bald, hairstyles 1-17 are female only, 18-23 are mixed, 24-32 are male only; hairstyles 1-26 use back hair sprite, others don't)
ears - 20+1 (1 no ears option, ears 1-16 have both inner and outer sprites, while 17-20 use only outer sprites)
horns - 20 (horns a bit weird, first 7 horns are "lower horns - under ears", next 2 have sprites for both lower and upper, while rest have exclusively upper sprites (above ears))
eyes - 8 (for anthros)
the numbers for demis  for eyes, hairstyles are very likely different

ExtendedBreastSprites = true;
FurCapable = true;

OFFSETS:
for weapons (anthros):
weapons for male bodies have to move 2 * .625f right in all states
weapons for weight stage 2 (fattest) bodies have to move 1 * .625f right in all states (so a male weight stage 2 wepon will always move 3 * .625f)
advanced melee weapon 1 (halberd) also has to move 19 * .625f up in attack state
advanced melee weapon 2 (longsword) also has to move 10 * .625f right in default state and 10 * .625f up in attack state

offsets for demis should be the same as offsets for humans 
I think ithey should be this:
hold 1 female weight stage 2 one pixel (1 * .625f) left
hold 2 female weight stage 2 one pixel right and one down
hold 3 female weight stage 2 one pixel down
hold 1 male weight stage 0 and 1 one pixel down
hold 1 male weight stage 2 one pixel down and one right
hold 2 male all weight stages two pixels right three pixels down
hold 3 male weight stage 0 and 1 three pixels down and three  right
hold 3 male weight stage 2 four pixels down and three right
(look below for descriptions which weapons go to which hold btw)

Spritesheets:

INFO:
hold 0 - (arm down open fist) - refers to not holding weapon at all or surrendered state
hold 1 - (arm down closed fist) - for all weapons default state other than advanced meelee 1 (halberd)
hold 2 - (arm middle position) - all weapon default attack state other than advanced meelee 1 plus default state for advanced meelee 1
hold 3 - (arm upper position) - melee advanced 1 attack state
*keep in mind that the human spritesheet have bodies in a different order than anthrodragons (goes hold 0->2->1->3)
